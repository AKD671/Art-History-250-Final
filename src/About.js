      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>Welcome to East Meets West: Dutch Art and the Ottoman World (17th Century), an online exhibition that uncovers the seeds of pre-modern Orientalism within Dutch art. This exhibition brings together a curated selection of six 17th-century paintings and prints, many of which are on view at the Art Institute of Chicago. These artworks offer a window into a time when Dutch artists, captivated by global exchange and cross-cultural curiosity, reimagined the Ottoman world through their own artistic lenses.</p>

<p>At the heart of this exhibition is a focus on a single kernel of pre-modern Orientalism: [KERNEL HERE]. This kernel — whether the shimmering luxury of Ottoman costumes, the imagined grandeur of Eastern architecture, or the presence of Eastern objects in Dutch domestic scenes — becomes a lens through which to examine the ways Dutch artists engaged with and appropriated Eastern aesthetics. In these images, we see a convergence of admiration, desire, and power: a fascination with the East as a place of opulence and otherness, and a simultaneous assertion of control over that difference through artistic representation.</p>

<p>The 17th century was a period of extraordinary cultural exchange, as the Dutch Republic rose to prominence as a global trading empire. Dutch merchants and diplomats navigated a complex web of trade routes that extended to Istanbul and beyond, bringing with them not only goods — silks, ceramics, spices — but also new ways of seeing and imagining the world. In these paintings and prints, Ottoman turbans and textiles became markers of prestige and exotic mystery, woven into biblical scenes and portraits that would have felt familiar to Dutch viewers yet thrillingly foreign at the same time.</p>

<p>This exhibition invites you to consider how these images reveal early impulses of pre-modern Orientalism, laying the groundwork for the more systematic and codified Orientalism of the 19th century. It also asks you to reflect on the enduring legacies of these images: how they shaped — and continue to shape — Western understandings of the East.</p>

<p>As you move through this exhibition, we invite you to engage deeply with the art and to consider the questions it raises about cultural encounter, representation, and power. What does it mean to depict another culture? How do fascination and fantasy intertwine in these images? And what can these centuries-old works tell us about the ongoing conversations between East and West in our world today?</p>
